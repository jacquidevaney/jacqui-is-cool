				<span class="dateline">LANGLEY, VA -</span> A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the report, sections of the documents &dash; almost invariably the most crucial passages" &dash; are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
			</p>

			CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
			 	<ul>
					<li>the Cold War</li>
					<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
					<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
				</ul>
